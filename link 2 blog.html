                    <h2>Html</h2>
                    <p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and
                        design
                        documents on the World Wide Web. It provides the structure and content for webpages by using a
                        series of tags and elements to define headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, and other
                        content.
                        Browsers interpret HTML code to display webpages that users can view and interact with. HTML is
                        fundamental to web development and works in conjunction with languages like CSS (Cascading Style
                        Sheets) and JavaScript to create visually appealing and dynamic websites.</p>

                    <h2>Css</h2>
                    <p>CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the
                        presentation and layout of a webpage written in HTML or other markup languages. It allows
                        developers
                        to control the visual appearance of elements on a webpage, including aspects like colors, fonts,
                        spacing, positioning, and responsiveness.

                        CSS works by applying styles to HTML elements using selectors, enabling consistent and efficient
                        design across a website. It also supports advanced features such as animations, transitions, and
                        media queries for creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
                        CSS
                        is essential for making websites visually appealing and user-friendly.</p>

                    <h2> JS</h2>
                    <p>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, dynamic programming language primarily used to create
                        interactive
                        and dynamic content on websites. It allows developers to add functionalities such as form
                        validation, interactive maps, animations, real-time updates, and more to webpages.

                        JavaScript runs in the browser, meaning it can respond to user actions like clicks, keyboard
                        input,
                        or mouse movements without needing to reload the page. It can also be used on the server-side
                        with
                        environments like Node.js. Overall, JavaScript is a core technology of the web, alongside HTML
                        and
                        CSS, enabling the creation of engaging and responsive user experiences.</p>
